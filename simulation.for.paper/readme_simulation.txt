Files and folders are named by LD range of causal variants. For example, 0_0.1 means r2 values between 0 and 01.

When a file exceeds the 100Mb limit of github, it is split into parts with a shared prefix. 
You can use "cat" to join these files. For example, the command "cat 1_causal.tar.gz.parta* > 1_causal.tar.gz" will produce the complete '1_causal.tar.gz' file.
